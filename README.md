🔭  I'm currently working on:
- 🏠 [Bruinrent](https://github.com/bruinrent/bruinrent), a web app for UCLA Bruins to more easily go through their apartment hunting journey
- ⌨️ Keyboard Armory, a business where I design and sell premium custom ergonomic mechanical keyboard cases
- 🔬 The UCLA bionics research lab's range of motion measurement, processing, interpretation, and display systems. Using [body tracking and virtual reality systems in C# and Unity](https://github.com/ryanmyang/Bionics-Research-Lab) along with [data processing in Python](https://github.com/ryanmyang/bionics-research-data-vis), I am helping to design ways to measure and understand stroke patients' range of motion and general mobility.
- 🍴 [Fork](https://github.com/JCamyre/fork/tree/main), a dish based diet and sustainability mobile app, with a passionate group of UCLA entrepreneurs


I've previously worked on:
- 📄 A customizable transcript summary creator, formatter, and processor powered by OpenAI, Python Flask, React.js, and Vercel
- 🚀 Software development for [Rocket Project at UCLA's liquid propellant rocket](https://github.com/UCLA-Rocket-Project/AresSoftware/tree/main)
- 🐶 Python and Arduino communication and controller for a robot dog named [Boelt](https://github.com/UCLAX1/Boelt-Software) with ASME at UCLA 
- 🚀 Leading software development systems for [Rocket Project at UCLA's hybrid propellant rocket](https://github.com/JackCadenhead/RocketProjectatUCLA/commits/main). We're programming arduinos for data collection, and processing and transferring data with python to display on a custom React GUI. 
- 📄 A collaborative text editor React web app as project with my CS35L project group
- 🔬 Sensor and pose calibration systems using body tracking in C# and Unity in the UCLA bionics research lab
